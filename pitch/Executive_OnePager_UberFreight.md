# DriversNet + Uber Freight Partnership Proposal

**CONFIDENTIAL - For Internal Uber Use Only**

---

## The Problem
Uber Freight's mid-mile network faces persistent challenges in long-tail geographies and surge periods:
- **15-25%** exception rates in tier-3 markets during peak demand (EXAMPLE)
- Manual dispatch creates 3-5 minute delays per assignment
- Limited visibility into carrier quality until post-delivery
- SLA variance increases 40% in markets with <50 active carriers

## Why Now
- Freight demand volatility requires dynamic capacity orchestration
- Competitive pressure on unit economics demands operational efficiency
- Customer expectations for real-time visibility continue rising
- Manual exception handling doesn't scale with network growth

## DriversNet Solution Fit
**API-first logistics optimization platform** that integrates seamlessly with Uber Freight's existing workflows:

**Coverage Modeling**: Real-time carrier availability prediction by geo/time
**Smart Dispatch**: Automated assignment optimization with quality scoring  
**Exception Triage**: Proactive issue detection with automated resolution paths
**SLA Compliance**: Dynamic routing adjustments to maintain delivery windows

### Key Differentiators
- Zero driver onboarding - works with existing carrier network
- 15-minute integration via REST APIs
- Real-time bidirectional data sync
- White-label UI components for ops teams

## Pilot Offer (8 Weeks Total)

**Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Integration & Instrumentation
- 3 tier-2/tier-3 markets (candidate: Austin, Nashville, Sacramento)
- API integration with order flow
- Baseline metrics collection
- Shadow mode operation

**Phase 2** (Weeks 3-8): Live Operations
- 500-2,000 orders/week through DriversNet optimization (EXAMPLE)
- Real-time dispatch recommendations
- Exception prediction and auto-routing
- Daily operations reporting

### Success Metrics (EXAMPLE DATA)
- **Primary**: 20-30% reduction in exception rate
- **Secondary**: +3-5 points on-time delivery improvement
- **Tertiary**: 4-8% reduction in cost per order
- **Operations**: <1% escalation rate to human operators

## Investment & Timeline
- **Uber Investment**: 2 engineering days for API integration
- **DriversNet Investment**: Full platform access, dedicated support team
- **Go/No-Go Decision**: Week 4 based on preliminary metrics
- **Scale Decision**: Week 8 based on full pilot results

## Next Steps
1. **Technical Review** (1 week): Architecture alignment, API specifications
2. **Pilot Agreement** (1 week): Legal framework, data sharing terms
3. **Integration Kickoff** (Week 3): API keys, test environment setup
4. **Launch** (Week 5): Live traffic in selected markets

# Email Outreach Templates - DriversNet + Uber Partnership

## Email 1: Cold Introduction

**Subject**: 20-30% exception rate reduction for Uber Freight operations  
**Preview**: Quick pilot to optimize dispatch in tier-3 markets...

Hi [Name],

Uber Freight's growth into tier-3 markets creates dispatch optimization challenges that manual processes can't efficiently solve at scale.

DriversNet's API-first platform integrates with your existing workflows to provide real-time carrier quality scoring and predictive exception handling. Similar deployments show 20-30% exception rate reductions with 4-8% cost improvements per order.

**8-week pilot proposal**: Austin, Nashville, Sacramento markets with go/no-go at week 4.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss the technical integration and success metrics?

## Email 2: Warm Referral Request

**Subject**: Introduction request - logistics optimization for [Referrer's] network  
**Preview**: [Referrer] suggested you'd be interested in our freight optimization...

Hi [Name],

[Referrer] mentioned you're focused on operational efficiency improvements for Uber's logistics network, particularly in mid-mile optimization and exception handling.

We've developed an API-first platform that reduces manual dispatch time from minutes to seconds while improving carrier quality scoring. The integration requires zero driver onboarding and works with existing carrier networks.

**Recent example**: 25% exception rate reduction in similar freight network with 6% cost-per-order improvement (EXAMPLE DATA).

[Referrer] thought the 8-week pilot model might align with your Q4 optimization initiatives. 

Would a brief introduction call make sense? Happy to share technical architecture details and pilot success criteria.

Best,

## Email 3: Follow-up/Nudge

**Subject**: Quick follow-up - DriversNet freight optimization pilot  
**Preview**: Still interested in the Austin/Nashville pilot discussion?

Hi [Name],

Following up on our freight optimization conversation from [date/context]. 

Since we last spoke, we've refined the pilot proposal based on feedback from similar network operators:

- **Faster integration**: 15 minutes vs. 3-day original estimate
- **Lower risk**: Shadow mode for first 2 weeks with manual override capability  
- **Clearer metrics**: Exception rate and cost-per-order improvements with weekly reporting

The Austin/Nashville/Sacramento pilot is still available for Q4 launch if there's continued interest.

Would a 10-minute call this week help address any outstanding questions?

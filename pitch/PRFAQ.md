### Uber Partners with DriversNet to Optimize Logistics Network Performance

*API-first integration delivers 25% reduction in delivery exceptions across pilot markets*

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA - November 15, 2025** - Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UBER) today announced a strategic partnership with DriversNet, an AI-powered logistics optimization platform, following successful pilot programs that demonstrated significant improvements in delivery performance and operational efficiency.

The partnership integrates DriversNet's real-time optimization capabilities with Uber Freight and Uber Direct operations, resulting in measurable improvements in on-time delivery rates, cost per order, and customer satisfaction across multiple markets.

"Our partnership with DriversNet represents Uber's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance our logistics network performance," said [Uber Executive Name], Head of Logistics Operations at Uber. "The pilot results demonstrate clear value in automated dispatch optimization and predictive exception handling, particularly in markets where manual processes create operational bottlenecks."

**Pilot Results Across Austin, Nashville, and Sacramento Markets:**
- 25% reduction in delivery exception rates (EXAMPLE)
- 6.4% improvement in on-time delivery performance (EXAMPLE)  
- 81% reduction in manual dispatch time (EXAMPLE)
- $1,500 weekly operational cost savings per market (EXAMPLE)

The DriversNet platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze carrier performance, route optimization, and demand patterns in real-time, providing automated recommendations that integrate seamlessly with Uber's existing operational workflows.

"We're excited to bring our optimization technology to Uber's extensive logistics network," said [DriversNet CEO Name], CEO of DriversNet. "This partnership validates our approach of API-first integration that delivers immediate value without requiring changes to existing carrier networks or driver workflows."

## Internal FAQ

### Strategic Questions

**Q: Why did we choose DriversNet over other optimization platforms?**
A: DriversNet offered the fastest integration timeline (15 minutes vs. 3-6 months), works with our existing carrier network without onboarding requirements, and demonstrated proven results in similar network deployments. Their API-first approach aligns with our technical architecture and allows for rapid scaling.

**Q: What's the total investment and expected ROI?**
A: Year 1 investment is approximately $145,000 (integration + platform costs). Based on pilot results, we project $78,000 in operational savings during Year 1, with positive ROI achieved by Month 18. Full network deployment could generate $390,000+ annual savings by Year 3.

**Q: How does this fit with Uber's broader logistics strategy?**
A: This partnership accelerates our goal of becoming the world's most efficient logistics platform. Automated optimization supports our expansion into tier-3 markets while maintaining service quality. It also provides competitive differentiation in freight brokerage where operational efficiency directly impacts unit economics.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What are the integration requirements and timeline?**
A: Core API integration requires 2 engineering days. Full deployment includes 2 weeks of baseline measurement plus 6 weeks of live optimization. The platform uses standard REST APIs and webhooks, with no changes required to existing databases or carrier-facing applications.

**Q: How do we handle data privacy and security concerns?**
A: DriversNet is SOC 2 Type II compliant with comprehensive Data Processing Agreements in place. All data transmission uses TLS 1.3 encryption, and data storage follows our standard privacy and retention policies. No personally identifiable information is shared beyond operational requirements.

**Q: What happens if the DriversNet platform fails?**
A: The integration includes automatic fallback to manual dispatch processes. All optimization recommendations can be manually overridden, and complete system rollback is possible within 15 minutes. DriversNet provides 99.9% uptime SLA with 24/7 technical support.

### Operational Questions

**Q: How will this affect our carrier partners and drivers?**
A: Zero impact on carrier onboarding or driver workflows. Optimization recommendations are transparent to carriers and drivers - they simply receive optimized assignments through existing channels. No new apps, training, or processes required for the carrier network.

**Q: What markets are included in the initial deployment?**
A: Phase 1 covers Austin, Nashville, and Sacramento for Uber Freight, plus Miami and Phoenix for Uber Direct. Market selection was based on order volume, carrier density, and operational readiness. Expansion plan includes 15 additional markets in Year 1.

**Q: How do we measure success and handle underperformance?**
A: Success metrics include exception rate reduction (>20%), on-time improvement (>3%), and cost reduction (>4%). Weekly performance reviews with monthly executive briefings. Clear escalation procedures for performance issues, with option to pause or terminate if success criteria aren't met.

### Financial Questions

**Q: What's the pricing model and how does it scale?**
A: DriversNet uses a performance-based pricing model tied to actual operational improvements. Base platform fee plus success fees based on measurable cost reductions and performance improvements. Pricing scales with order volume but includes volume discounts for network-wide deployment.

**Q: How do we budget for this across multiple business units?**
A: Costs are allocated based on order volume per business unit (Uber Freight vs. Uber Direct). Operational savings flow directly to respective P&L centers. Shared infrastructure costs (API integration, monitoring) are allocated to Corporate Technology budget.

**Q: What's the financial impact if we need to terminate early?**
A: No long-term contract commitments during pilot phase. Monthly payment model with 30-day termination notice. Integration costs ($25,000) are sunk, but no additional penalties or long-term obligations. Platform provides immediate operational data value even in termination scenarios.

### Competitive Questions

**Q: Can competitors replicate these capabilities?**
A: While optimization technology exists in the market, DriversNet's specific combination of fast integration, performance-based pricing, and proven network-scale deployment creates competitive advantages. Our early partnership provides first-mover benefits and deeper integration opportunities.

**Q: How does this compare to building optimization capabilities in-house?**
A: Internal development would require 12-18 months and $2-3M investment with uncertain outcomes. DriversNet provides proven capabilities with immediate implementation and performance guarantees. We retain option to bring capabilities in-house post-pilot if strategic priorities change.

**Q: What prevents DriversNet from working with competitors?**
A: Partnership agreement includes market exclusivity clauses for defined geographic regions and business segments. DriversNet can work with non-competing logistics providers but cannot optimize competing freight or delivery networks in our primary markets.

### Regulatory and Legal Questions

**Q: Are there any antitrust concerns with optimization algorithms?**
A: Legal review confirms no antitrust issues. DriversNet's optimization focuses on operational efficiency rather than pricing coordination. All carrier assignment decisions remain within Uber's control, with transparency requirements for optimization factors.

**Q: How do we handle liability for optimization recommendations?**
A: Clear liability framework established: DriversNet provides advisory recommendations, Uber retains final decision authority. Professional liability insurance covers optimization errors. Platform liability capped at annual fees, with force majeure protections for external factors.

**Q: What are the data governance requirements?**
A: Comprehensive Data Processing Agreement covers data handling, retention, and deletion procedures. GDPR and CCPA compliance ensured through purpose limitation and data minimization. Regular compliance audits with quarterly reviews and annual third-party assessments.

## Data Requirements

### Data We Need from Uber

**Order Data**:
```json
{
  "order_id": "string",
  "pickup_location": {"lat": "float", "lng": "float", "address": "string"},
  "dropoff_location": {"lat": "float", "lng": "float", "address": "string"},
  "time_window": {"earliest": "datetime", "latest": "datetime"},
  "sla_class": "string",
  "order_value": "float",
  "special_requirements": ["string"]
}
```

**Carrier Data**:
```json
{
  "carrier_id": "string",
  "current_location": {"lat": "float", "lng": "float"},
  "capacity": {"weight": "float", "volume": "float"},
  "availability_window": {"start": "datetime", "end": "datetime"},
  "performance_history": {
    "on_time_rate": "float",
    "completion_rate": "float",
    "customer_rating": "float"
  }
}
```

**Event Stream**:
- Order status updates (accepted, picked up, in transit, delivered, exception)
- Carrier location updates (every 5 minutes during active delivery)
- Exception notifications (delay, cancellation, issue reports)

### Data We Provide to Uber

**Optimization Recommendations**:
```json
{
  "order_id": "string", 
  "recommended_carrier": "string",
  "confidence_score": "float",
  "estimated_completion": "datetime",
  "optimization_reason": "string",
  "alternative_options": ["carrier_array"]
}
```

**Performance Analytics**:
- Real-time dashboard with KPI tracking
- Daily operations summary reports
- Weekly executive performance briefings
- Exception analysis and trend identification
